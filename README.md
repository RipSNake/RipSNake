 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastian, born and raised in Mar del Plata, Bs As, Argentina. 
  
  I'm developing myself as a Professional JavaScript FullStack Web Developer.
  
  I'd reached the world of computer programming 🖥 taking a JAVA/Hibernate/MySQL initial course.  
  After that one year's first encounter, and with guidance of one of my friends, <br />
  I decided to 📖 start learning the foundations 🧱 on to which web site's are built 🛠. 

- 🌱 I'm currently improving my React and Frontend skills to increase accessibility semantics and expertise.
- 🎸 I'm a bass player and I love music: metal, rock🎸, jazz🎺, bossa, classical, dubstep, etc 🎶🥁🎶
- 🧡 I love my family (Vicky🦸‍, Emma & Roma🐶🐶) and spending time with them, their smiles are unique, and fill me up with so much energy🔋.
- 👀 I'm also very curious and enjoy so much leaning new things every time I can.

- 💞️ I’m looking to improve my knowledge and participate into new projects, ideally with international teams.


This are some of the Skills I have been working with:

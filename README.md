 👋 Hi, I’m @RipSNake(SJGuzman) I live in Mar del Plata, Bs As, Argentina. 
  
  I'm developing myself to be a Professional JavaScript FullStack Web Developer.
  
  I'd reached the world of computer programming🖥 taking a JAVA/Hibernate/MySQL initial course.  
  After that one year's long first encounter, and with guidance of one of my friends, <br />
  I decided to 📖 start learning the foundations 🧱 on how web site's are built 🛠. 
  
 - 👨‍🎓 The lastest bootcamp I've taken was organized by Alkemy Labs (https://www.alkemy.org). We worked as a developer's team with MySQL, Express, React and NodeJs developing a web API.
    We worked with formik, Material UI, Chakra UI, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, Scrum and bitbucket among some other packages. 

- 🌱 I'm currently learning React, NodeJS, an a little bit of Angular watching tutorials and taking courses to continue growing.
- 🎸 I'm a bass player and I love music: metal, rock🎸, jazz🎺, bossa, classical, dubstep, etc 🎶🥁🎶
- 🧡 I love my family (Vicky🦸‍, Emma & Roma🐶🐶) and spending time and playing with them, their smiles, they are unique, and fill me with so much energy🔋.
- 👀 I'm also very curious and enjoy so much leaning new things every time I can.

- 💞️ Nowadays I’m looking to land my first job as a web developer to start my IT Carrear and be a part of this amazing industry.
